version <next>

version 1.0.1:
- Fix a couple of compile warnings in Java 1.5

- Tidy up exception handling when loading Robot controllers a bit (a lot
  more needs to be done). User friendly error messages are now displayed
  for a few common cases.

- Loading Robot controllers from the CLI now selects the correct controller
  once the GUI starts up.

version 1.0:
- Add Javadocs for IRobot and remove the methods setTargetLocation() and
  setMaze() from the interface. Students writing controllers shouldn't have 
  access to either of those methods.

- Add command line options to preload controllers and saved mazes.
  Refactoring to allow this.

- Add keyboard shortcuts for practically everything.

- Add editable fields for the width and height in the Advanced settings panel.

- Fix the broken list views, and stackdumps on MacOS X.

- Fix the intermittent freeze on startup bug.

- Add parameter validation for IRobot methods.

- Make accessors that return points return copies of those points, so that
  client code can't modify the internal state of the maze software.

- Update Kunststoff L&F to version 2.0.2.

- Make the MazeGridPanel always resize the maze so that the cells are square

- Remove the Make Generator feature. Load/save maze works better, and doesn't
  rely on Sun's compiler classes to be present

- Tweak save maze button to only be enabled when there's a maze to save

- Add John Fearnley's loopy maze generator

- Tweak about box and copyright info

- Add GPL license information to source code

- Dragging the robot/target outside the maze doesn't generate exceptions

- Double clicking the robot rotates it clockwise 90 degrees.

- Add load/save functionality
